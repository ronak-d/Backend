diff between eg() and eg, inside app.use();

eg() => invokes function where eg passes an function as in terms of object and
        has more precedent weightage then function invocations.

app.use(eg) => ussed when to access middleware -> middlewares are function .
             -> we directly passes function without invocation.
             -> .use is from express use this syntax to pass and run middleware first.
